It also makes it easy to find and reference important reservation details like a listing's address, your itinerary, check-in details, and other useful information. We can’t provide these benefits if your reservation isn’t booked and paid for directly through Airbnb.
                Paying or communicating outside of Airbnb also makes it harder for us to protect your information and puts you at greater risk of fraud and other security issues, such as phishing.</td>
